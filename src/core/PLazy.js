/**
 * This method creates a lazy promise which is only executed
 * when `.then` or `.catch` are called on the PLazy instance.
 *
 * Since this class is used internally and never meant to be
 * used as a public interface, we take the advantage or
 * creating a non-complaint promise constructor.
 *
 * ## NOTE
 * Never use this class in your own code, there are better implementations
 * of lazy promises on npm.
